So far, my professional experience has been that of developing and/or maintaining software for chemical industries, such as chemicals manufacturing ‚öó, oil üè≠, water treatment üíß and coating üõ°.

I know a thing or two about process simulation and optimization algorithms with Python üêç, as I did some research on the topic during my last year at the university and developed one myself, for separation of rare-earth elements, as part of my thesis.
