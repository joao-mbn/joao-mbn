I'm currently working at [Radix](https://www.radixeng.com.br/) as a Junior Fullstack Software Developer.

Developing and/or maintaining software for industries (such as chemicals, oil, water treatment, etc.) that outsourced to us. Usually it involved automating their workflow, connecting different sources of information while creating friendly interface so that users from different parts of these processes could team-up effortlessly.

While these jobs required that I worked in the front-end, back-end and database (sometimes with Cloud services too), I've tried to stay as much as possible in the front-end. Thus, I'm most comfortable working as a front-end developer, though possessing some knowledge to be productive in the other parts.
