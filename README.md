### Hi there ü§ô

I'm Jo√£o, a Junior Fullstack Software Developer at [Radix](https://www.radixeng.com.br/).

Developing and/or maintaining software for industries (such as chemicals ‚öó, oil üè≠, water treatment üíß, etc.) that outsourced to us. 

Usually it involved automating their workflow, connecting different sources of information while creating friendly interface so that users from different parts of these processes could team-up effortlessly.

While these jobs required that I worked in the front-end, back-end and database (sometimes with Cloud services too), I've tried to stay as much as possible in the front-end. Thus, I'm most comfortable working as a front-end developer, though possessing some knowledge to be productive in the other parts.
